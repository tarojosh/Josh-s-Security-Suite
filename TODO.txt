TODO:
- Create unit tests for each cli command with PyTest
- Add new command: store
	- Stores a password and name of the login site associated with it to a file
	- Example: Website:	Youtube
		   Username:	Josh
		   Password:	SDF89000_77
		- Should the user be able to store other information related to websites? What if they use a different DOB for each website and they want to record that?
