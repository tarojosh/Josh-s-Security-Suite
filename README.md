# Josh's Security Suite
A set of password security tools made using Python and Click

## Description
Josh's Security Suite is a personal CLI project built as an extension of a university assignment for User Interfaces & Design.

It includes three core tools for basic password handling:

    A password generator for creating strong ASCII-based passwords

    An encryptor that base64-encodes passwords

    A decryptor for quickly reversing base64-encoded strings

The project uses the Click framework to create a multi-command CLI app (mytools), packaged using Poetry.

Intended as a learning experience, this suite will be gradually expanded into a personal set of lightweight security utilities.
